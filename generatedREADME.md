  ## Description
  This is a weather forecast dashboard created to bring together content learnt in the bootcamp so far (javascript, dayjs, JQuery, APIs) and specifically practice use of server APIs. The OpenWeatherMap API is used to retrieve and display the current weather, as well as the 5-day forecast, for a location searched for by the user, and saves the last five searches to the local storage for easy retrieval.
