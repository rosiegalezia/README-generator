# README-generator
A README.md generator command-line application created for the week 11 challenge.

## Description

This project is a command-line application that accepts user inputs, that can be used by developers to create meaningful READMEs. This project brough together the node.js and ES6 content learnt in week 11 of the 16-week Front-End Web Development Bootcamp. It was also my first time using a .gitignore file! The README created by the application is created in a file titled 'generatedREADME.md'.

It meets all the outlined acceptance criteria:
 * When a user is prompted for information about the application repository then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title, and 8 sections containing important information. ‚úÖ
 * When a user enters the project title then it is displayed as the title of the README. ‚úÖ
 * When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests. ‚úÖ
 * When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under. ‚úÖ
 * When a user enters their GitHub username then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile. ‚úÖ
 * When a user enters their email address then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions. ‚úÖ
 * When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents then they are taken to the corresponding section of the README. ‚úÖ
 * Uses the inquirer package. ‚úÖ

## Credits

üëè A list of all the markdown licenses crearted by [Lukas Himsel](https://gist.github.com/lukas-h) was used to display the badges in the generated READMEs. The list of badges can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba).

üëè [Nadia's](https://github.com/nayafia) [contributing template](https://github.com/nayafia/contributing-template/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING-template.md) was used as a basis for the default contributing guide used in the generated README.
